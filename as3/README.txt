Part 1
======

To run part 1, run the PedestriansTrain and PedestriansRun java projects.


Part 2
======

To collect data for part 2, run the NavigateTerrain project. It will give you
instructions as to when to select the colour to track for the robot. This will
generate p2data.arff.

Generate the model using WEKA with the parameters provided in the report. Our
model p2.model is provided.

Generate the images (using the generated model) by running the ProduceMap project.

The robot will follow the path coded by running the FollowRoad project.


Part 3
======

To train the model, run the TravelStraight project. This will produce the p3.agt
agent file. To run the model, run TravelStraight with the --test option.
