k) We can conclude that the power for each motor is not the same. We can also
conclude that friction differs across different surfaces. We can conclude
these two facts because the motors require different power when travelling in
a straight line. And the robot may travel in a circle on one surface, and not
on another due to the change in friction.

Implementation:

Our implementation for finding the final position and heading of the robot
works by using frequent measurements from the tachometers. Each wheels
tachometer is read every 10 milliseconds. The readings are used to calculate
change in heading and the change in distance. These are in turn used to find
the change in x and change in y. On every iteration the change in y, change in x,
and change in heading are incrementally added to the stored x, y, and heading.
The final output is the cumulative x, y, and heading values.

a1) We will measure the x and y travel using a ruler( the actual value), and
compare that with the x and y movement measured by the
tachometer (the expected value). The difference between these values
at varying powers, will be the error.

a2) We will perform the above analysis but instead of measuring
the distance with a ruler, we will use two distance sensors. One
facing to the side and one facing forward. This will act as the
actual distance moved.

b1) We will measure the error in heading by using the theta moved
calculated using the tachometer as the expected value. And we will
measure the actual heading by hand using a ruler and measuring the
heading by hand.
