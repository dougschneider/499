k) We can conclude that the power for each motor is not the same. We can also
conclude that friction differs across different surfaces. We can conclude
these two facts because the motors require different power when travelling in
a straight line. And the robot may travel in a circle on one surface, and not
on another due to the change in friction.

Implementation:

Our implementation for finding the final position and heading of the robot
works by using frequent measurements from the tachometers. Each wheels
tachometer is read every 10 milliseconds. The readings are used to calculate
change in heading and the change in distance. These are in turn used to find
the change in x and change in y. On every iteration the change in y, change in x,
and change in heading are incrementally added to the stored x, y, and heading.
The final output is the cumulative x, y, and heading values.
